## Recurring feedback

<!-- session d3bfe61c 2026-08-21 -->
- When dealing with system-level behavior (process structure, launch modes), investigate the actual implementation BEFORE making changes. Do not skip groundwork — ask about or explore implementation details proactively when first encountering such tasks.

<!-- session cc97e40c 2026-08-20 -->
- Previous CI analysis (Aug 19) was "too confident" with insufficient diagnostics — next time, prioritize adding `go env`, version logging, and artifact inspection to feedback loops so debugging doesn't restart from scratch
- When saving documentation for multi-project work, write to the target project's `.claude/docs/` folder, not to violation-framework's memory system — project context matters even when you're physically in another directory

## Agent errors

<!-- session d3bfe61c 2026-08-21 -->
- Made assumptions about `process.pid` without checking the actual process topology first. User asked for three PIDs (exe, node, tray) and assistant initially didn't know the structure existed, requiring correction to investigate the startup code.

<!-- session cc97e40c 2026-08-20 -->
- Attempted to save project feedback memory to violations-framework/.claude/memory instead of wdrive/.claude/docs — confused physical working directory with project context; user called this out as "completely stupid"
- Used inline `node -e` despite guardrail block, then wasted rounds creating/editing temporary scripts before adapting; should immediately pivot to script file approach when guardrails block inline execution

<!-- session 88dc8bf5 2026-08-19 -->
- Agent made 8 sequential EDIT calls to `packages/violations-rules/src/rules/index.ts` instead of batching related import/export changes — could update index in fewer operations by combining related additions (imports, exports, allRules array entries) into one or two larger edits.

## Documentation gaps

<!-- session cc97e40c 2026-08-20 -->
- When Go version mismatches occur between `go-version-file` (reads directive) and explicit `go-version:` in workflows, CI produces different binaries but logs nothing — added diagnostic output in build-tray-binary.yml to expose actual GOVERSION/GOTOOLCHAIN/GOROOT on next run

## Known constraints

<!-- session cc97e40c 2026-08-20 -->
- User's GitHub artifact storage is permanently full — cannot recommend GitHub artifacts as a solution; must use git-based verification (commit SHAs, git log staleness) instead
